      Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.

      <div id="pre" style="display: none;">The ultimate goal of natural language processing is for computers to achieve human-like comprehension of texts/languages. When this is achieved, computer systems will be able to understand, draw inferences from, summarize, translate and generate accurate and natural human text and language.<br></div>

          <div class="content">
            <p class="transition hidden">Natural Language Processing is a field of computer science that deals with communication between computer systems and humans. It is a technique used in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. It is used to create automated software that helps understand human spoken languages to extract useful information from the data it gets in the form of audio. Techniques in NLP allow computer systems to process and interpret data in the form of natural languages.</p>

            <i class="dropdown icon"></i>What are stop words? </div>
          <div class="content">
            <p class="transition hidden">Stop words are said to be useless data for a search engine. Words such as articles, prepositions, etc. are considered as stop words. There are stop words such as was, were, is, am, the, a, an, how, why, and many more. In Natural Language Processing, we eliminate the stop words to understand and analyze the meaning of a sentence. The removal of stop words is one of the most important tasks for search engines. Engineers design the algorithms of search engines in such a way that they ignore the use of stop words. This helps show the relevant search result for a query.</p>

            <p class="transition hidden">English nouns are only inflected for number and possession. New nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding. They are semantically divided into proper nouns (names) and common nouns. Common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns, and grammatically into count nouns and mass nouns. <br>

            Most count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural suffix -s, but a few nouns have irregular plural forms. Mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier, e.g. one loaf of bread, two loaves of bread.</p>
